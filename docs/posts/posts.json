    "contents": "\nMidterm Proposal\nThe Project: Textbook Chapter\nMy proposed final paper will consist of a book chapter on learning meant for my undergraduate Motivation and Learning class that I currently teach at Baruch College. The class is currently designed to cover topics of both motivation and learning; however, I have not found a textbook that covers both topics together (most books are focused on solely motivation). Because I do not want students to purchase another book for class, I would like to use the final project as an opportunity to create an open source chapter on the topic that can be tailored to my class.\nWhat the Chapter Would Consist Of\nThis chapter would cover of 5 sections that would be meant to discuss over 4 classes in total. Each section will start out with learning objectives that will be tailored to the specific class topic, then include the material about the topic, and also include mini exercises meant to guide reading (e.g., critical reflection questions, case studies, etc.). Specifically, exercises will be geared to applying the class concepts in relation to motivation (e.g., how might operant learning influence intrinsic/extrinsic behaviors)\nIntroduction to Learning and Cognitions\nThis brief section help to introduce the topic of learning and cognition to students. Given that students will be finishing their unit on Motivational Needs, this introduction is needed to help them transition and orient students into the Learning and Cognitions part of class. This part will define what learning and cognition is, address the connection between both concepts, talk about how learning relates to motivation, and discuss the importance of learning in our lives.\nClassical Conditioning\nThis section will focus on classical learning, which will concentrate on how we learn through association. The chapter will cover topics such as defining the key concepts, discussing a brief history of the topic (e.g., Pavlov), go into the specifics of the conditioning steps, briefly touch into the processes related to conditioning (e.g., extinction/acquisition/spontaneous recovery, generalization vs discrimination), and then touch on real world applications of conditioning.\nOperant Conditioning\nThis section will focus on operant learning, which will concentrate on how we learn through rewards and punishments. The chapter will cover topics such as defining the key concepts (e.g., reinforcers, punishers), discussing a brief history of the topic (e.g., Thorndike’s law of Effect and Skinner Boxes), go into the specifics of the different types of operant learning, touch upon the differences between classical vs. operant conditioning, go into primary vs secondary reinforcers, briefly touch into the schedules of reinforcement, and then then touch on real world applications (e.g., behavioral shaping).\nObservational Learning This section will focus on observational learning, which will concentrate on how we learn by watching others. The chapter will cover topics such as defining the key, discussing a brief history of the topic (e.g., Tolman, Bandura), outline the modeling process, and discuss the impacts of observational learning through real world applications.\nChapter Summary This short section will focus on the overall summary of the topics discussed in the chapter. Additionally, student activities will be provided to help students test their overall knowledge and apply the concepts based on all the above sections.\nHow This Chapter Will Be Used\nThis chapter will be used to transition into the topic of learning and cognitions for a Motivation and Learning class. The students will be assigned the class readings, which will be used as a guide for the class lecture (e.g., concepts, activities, discussion) and homework activities (e.g., end of chapter quiz, reflection questions… focused in the context of motivation). This book will help students become more knowledgeable in areas of learning, which will be applied to motivational concepts later in the class.\nBibliography\nWindholz, G. (1997). Ivan P.

    "contents": "\nSemester Project Ideas\nIdea 1: Mini Textbook on Learning for Undergraduate Students\nI currently teach Psychology of Motivation and Learning class to undergraduate students at Baruch College. While I really like the textbook on motivation, it unfortunately does not cover learning topics. In fact, I have yet to find a book that incorporates both motivation and learning concepts into one. I have not found any open source book chapters that I like that relate to motivation as well for my students to use.\nWith that, my goal would be to develop a textbook chapter for my undergraduate students on learning (as it relates to motivation). In doing so, I would want to make an interactive textbook that highlights the ways to which we learn that are packed with motivation examples. This could be helpful to provide a more comprehensive understanding of learning as it relates to motivation. It will help me to understand ways to better teach the topic better to students and also help to provide a resource to future instructors who teach this class.\nGoals\nOverview of major theories related to learning\nInclude general overview of historical underpinnings of learning theories\nConnection to motivation and cognition\nProvide examples as it relates to motivation and real-world application\nHave exercises in the textbook to help students reflect on learning (e.g., short quiz, discussion questions)\nIdea 2: Literature Review on Decision-Making Processes Related to Fathers’ Utilization of Work-Family Policies\nMy research focuses on the predictors and inhibitors of fathers utilization of work-family policies. While I currently use a resource/occupational health-related perspective to examine this, I see a benefit in understanding such research from a cognitive perspective. Specifically, I would want to do a literature review on a judgement/decision-making perspective for why fathers use work-family policies. While I know this is a very targeted topic, I might need to expand on the research to focus on parents in general. In doing so, this project could help me to become more familiar about my research area from another perspective, which will help me become a better researcher.\nGoals\nUnderstand judgement and decision making literature\nExamine literature as it relates to decision making for work-family policy use\nSynthesize reading into literature review to highlight major themes\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nMy First Post: Unstructured Writing Assignment\nKolers, P. A., & Roediger, H. L. (1984). Procedures of mind. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 23(4), 425–449. https://doi.org/10/b7gfkh\nAbstract/Main Idea: Research commonly studies learning/memory based on info acquisition, storage, and retrieval. This can be problematic because information and the mind are considered to be/have physical-like traits. Article argues for more process-oriented perspective of info processing. With this, mind is seen as a skill of manipulating symbols while skills give a useful framework for understanding important aspects of cognitive processes\nIntro: Before there was a focus on acquisition, retention, and transfer of learning…but no talk about mind, mentation, info processing, cognition, or memory.\nOutline: - assumptions of learning and memory assumptions, point out weakness - propose alt view based on functions of mind as basis of knowledge - apply view to memory pheno\nConventional Assumptions of Memory Theories: “Mental processes are often described as objects or events in an actual physical space as when we speak of storing and organizing memories, of searching through them, or of holding or grasping ideas in our minds; like objects, memories may be lost or hard to find, and so on”\nSpatial Storage and Search: memory is similar to computer w/ electronic circuits…but should not describe how we function\nStructure – Process Distinction: stored in place, but not be productive\nStructure: everything is connected…but not sure what we are representing\nProcess: mind is static object and processes act upon such structures to remember or think…but assumes there’s an exec/constraints in charge which may not be the case\nMemory as Conscious Recollection: idea we remember but there might be a dissociation between remembering consciously and performance\nSemantic Primacy: memory is a byproduct of stages of analysis from shallow surface features to semantic processing of language that’s deeply encoded…but we cant tell how things look/are by looking at them only\nA Procedural Account of Performance: Authors propose to “accommodate declarative knowledge in operationalizable terms of actions–the procedures that characterize a person’s acquisition and use of knowledge.” -Declarative knowledge: I know THAT (sem/episode mem) - Procedural knowledge: I know HOW (procedure w skills)\nEvidence for a Proceduralist View\nRefutation of Semantic Primacy: W/ procedural account, knowledge acquired through reading or listening depends on cognitive skills of the perceiver. Other issues focused on duration of ST memory, superficial features carry info but not important for LT. “The way that memorability changes as a function of a person’s acquiring skill with a symbol set remains to be worked out. In light of experts’ performance, it seems plausible that memorability is a U shaped function of skill, increasing again as skill becomes expertise.”\nMeans Dependent Knowledge: Claimed people learn from various media by abstracting and storing their contents but did NOT focus on ways info was acquired. Acquisition and processing of symbols are part of a single indivisible operation.\nSpecificity of Transfer: may not be transfer of muscle groups or formal similarity. Instead, pattern recognition may play a role and w limited transfer. With that, it’s proposed that “positive transfer occurs in relation to the similarity of procedures that two tasks exercise”\nTransfer vs Dissociation of Skills: memory has been traditionally understood as content of mind compared to procedures used to acquire/express knowledge. Propose that “effects of experiences depend upon the procedures used to realize them rather than upon some description of them . . . dissociation does NOT need to be explained, for that is the natural state of affairs; instead it’s the characteristics of tasks/relations among underlying procedures– that need explaining. Responses are specific to skills in manipulating systems of symbols and there is no necessary connection among responses.\nConsciousness: Focus should be on what one can do than what one knows. Rather than focus on it like a machine, we should focus on consciousness as how sensing organs respond to events (selective monitoring).\nApplications and Extensions\nEncoding Phenomena: view that repetition of action…generation effect can be accommodated by a proceduralist account of learning and memory.??\nInteraction of Acquisition and Test: View knowledge is source dependent. More similar procedures during two occasions, more successful performance will be at the later. Learning is specific to exercise of specific skills.\nRecovery: Any complex event has multiple component activities, and more alike they are, the more alike the behavior will be.\nReprise: Belief that mind should be seen as procedures/skills one has on on cog tasks instead of expressed through hypo contents or structures of mind. View allows us to view cog process as skills that transfer differentially to new tasks…seen as unifying principle to organize behave patterns of behavior. Also believes complex skills can be seen as made of simpler components. Likewise, logic of transfer of training can be used to identify and study the component skills. Procedural description of mental processes encourages focusing on observables ->> do we see any weakness to this? “Behavior is situation specific, but its description clearly should have some generality.” Authors believe cog psych should focus on mind as skill in manipulating symbols. This can be seen acquisition of reference (symbol creation), skill in transforming and manipulating symbols (recognition and problem solving), and their application to new occasions (transfer).\n“We claim that knowledge of objects is specific to the means of experiencing them” – focus less on abstract and more on ways to which something is learned/acquired…consistency is important for remembering\nOverall thoughts: paper was hard to read (really dense). What do we mean by dissociation? I like process/procedural view better in showing complexity and dynamics. But how do we disentangle this. While this is trying to make things less complex and show more procedures and behaviors, how can we test this? What are some examples of this in real world/that we can apply (e.g., education, workplace)?\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nNewell, A. (1973). You can’t play 20 questions with nature and win: Projective comments on the papers of this symposium. https://doi.org/10/gd4vz2\nDetection: Psychology deals with phenomena. Pheno are dealt with in many different ways. Psychology also attempts to conceptualize what it is doing (as guide to investigate pheno)…but this is often binary (nature/nurture).\n2 constructs drive our experimental style: (1) at a low level, discovery & empirical exploration of pheno and (2) at middle level, formulation of questions to be put to nature that center on the resolution of binary oppositions. At high level, we focus on general big pic questions (how is language used)…but lower levels help us to experiment and give explan to pheno.\nBUT clarity is never achieved in science…instead matters get “muddier and muddier” in time. Psych issues have difficulty fading away. View is that science advances with playing 20 questions w nature…(question binary that has an experiment…but question isn’t answered and strat not helpful).\nIs it possible to detangle complexity? Do we embrace it?\nDiagnosis\nOn Methods: behavior is programmable. To predict a person one must know: “(1) the goals; (2) the structure of the task environment; and (3) the invariant structure of his processing mechanisms.”…As a result, we are totally engaged in psych exper, in discovery and verification of specific methods used by the subject in doing the exper tasks. The task is to discover the structure that is fixed/invariant to infer theo a method. Given goal of the subject and the task environment faced, we will generate (small) collection of methods likely to be used by person to perform task. After, perform post-hoc analysis of the subject’s performance we can settle on method person uses. Without such a framework within which to work, the generation of new methods, hence new explanations, for old phenomena will go on….BUT this doesn’t operate within a frame that constrains what other methods might also be evoked to perform the same task….AS RESULT there’s no model to the control structure (aka specifying the conditional sequence and what it does). As result, if control structure (seen as glue) is missing so not possible to suggest an indefinite sequence of alternative possibilities for how a given task was performed…it prevents theoretical issues from becoming settled.\nPutting it Together: Another issue is that we don’t put results of all experiments together. Hard to integrate everything we know then. Not so much a concern of many methods and findings…it’s more about how they will add up with each other in the future.\nPrognosis (we need things to add up)\nComplete Processing Models: construct complete processing models rather than the partial ones we now do (…given this was 50 years ago, what stops us from doing this now)//helps to address complexity and complication\nAnalyze a Complex Task: to accept a single complex task and do all of it (aim to focus a series of experimental and theoretical studies around a single complex task, the aim being to demonstrate that one has a sufficient theory of a genuine slab of human behavior) (…but can we ever get to fully address complexity and complex pheno)//acknowledge contradictions to better understand pheno\nOne Program for Many Tasks: stay with the diverse collection of small experimental tasks, but to construct a single system to perform them all (…arent there many different ways to org one thing)//program to perform everything like AI\nConclusion: We need to find a way to put everything together.\nThoughts: We have metas now…but they can be problematic. How do we also ensure quality while sifting through quantity? Where do we go now as a field with combining things? If we do this, wont it just become more complex as we try to intertwine different areas of study together (this might also be a benefit as well).\n\n\n\n",
